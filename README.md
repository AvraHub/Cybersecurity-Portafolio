Hi everyone! In this repository I'm thrilled to share my learning journey through various courses that I took and accomplished so that I can save my progress and showcase my knowledge 
in certain topics. I consider myself as a tech-curious guy so I once and there in my spare time I'd like to dive into what's new within the cybersecurity field. Furthermore if I can
work something related to that, I'd be more than happy to team up and counter-attack or defent the surface danger that possible malicious attackers wnat to penetrate.
